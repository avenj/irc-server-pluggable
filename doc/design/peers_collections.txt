### IRC::Peer / IRC::Peers / IRC::Users / IRC::User rework


## Peers

- All seen peers live in Protocol peers() attrib (IRC::Peers)

- Introduced peers are added under their introducing peer (ie, the PREFIX)
  via their peers() identifier, this is a Tree::Network under Peers.pm

- An IRC::Peer has a route()
 - A local  peer's route() is conn->wheel_id
 - A remote peer's route() is the conn->wheel_id of the introducing local 
   peer

- An IRC::Peer needs to be associated with Users in a way that makes it 
  efficient to grab the tree of users under the Peer
  ? Maintaining a set of pointers back to Protocol->users objects may be 
  the best approach even if it's heavy.

## Users

Options:
 - Maintain all known users in Protocol->users
    Maintain a peer association for each user
    > Pros:
      Can quickly find user and their route_id
    > Cons:
      Need to be able to quickly get all users for a peer
      and drop them in split situations
      Iterating is too slow

 - Maintain per-Peer sets of User objects
    Keep users contained in their respective Peer
    > Pros:

    > Cons:
      Need to be able to quickly grab a next-hop route_id
      

A User has a:
##  ->server()   Name of their local Peer
##  ->route()    ID of our Peer or next-hop Peer that introduced User
