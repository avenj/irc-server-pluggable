# IRC::Peer / IRC::Peers / IRC::Users / IRC::User rework


An IRC::Peer can have its own Peers collection

A Peers collection should have a method to find a user in the tree under 
it

A Protocol should have a method to query its top-level ->peers to find a 
trace to a user or a next-hop route-id

A bursted User or Server should have a next-hop route-id

A bursted Server should belong to a peer of a peer

A split situation should delist all peers of the peer that split and all 
users of that peer or peers beneath it
