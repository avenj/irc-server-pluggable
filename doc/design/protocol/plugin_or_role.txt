## Should Protocol behavior belong in a Plugin or a Role?

Guidelines:

 1. Should be a plugin:
  (a) if it's a user command *except* as specified in 2(a)
  (b) if it needs its own POE::Session to do some tertiary task(s)
      that relate to otherwise core functionality belonging to a role
      (Plugin::Register would be one example)

 2. Should be a role:
  (a) if it's core functionality / commonly required by other modules
