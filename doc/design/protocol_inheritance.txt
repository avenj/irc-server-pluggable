## Protocol:: class inheritance white board. :)

IRC::Pluggable::Protocol (TS3-ish ?)

  -> 'has a' relationship to IRC:: helper classes
  -> IRC:: Helper classes may maintain weak_refs to Protocol
      This is useful for reaching ->config

   !! IRC:: Helper classes may NOT change state in Protocol
      without using an interface defined in a Protocol::Role

      They may modify discrete objects such as Users, Channels, and 
      Peers.

  * Protocol::TS5 isa Protocol
     * Protocol::TS6 isa Protocol::TS5

  * Protocol::P10 isa Protocol

IRC::Pluggable::IRC::

  - Also see notes regarding Protocol interaction, above

  * Protocol::TS6::Users isa IRC::Users
    (-> Protocol::TS6 can override _build to create)
    (-> UIDs are primary keys?)

  * Protocol::TS6::User isa IRC::User
    (-> has 'uid')

  * Protocol::TS6::Peer isa IRC::Peer
    (-> has 'sid')


Role composition / plugin layout:
http://eris.cobaltirc.org/bug/1/13

  - Class wins over role
  - Roles can compose roles and override methods
  - Subclass can override or compose roles that override superclass roles

  * IRC::Pluggable::Protocol
    > with Protocol::Role::Clients
      -> with Protocol::Role::Clients::Commands
          (how much of this should be in plugins? likely most)

    > with Protocol::Role::Ping

    > with Protocol::Role::Peers
      -> linking behavior
          (how much of this should be in IRC::Peer(s)?)
          (how much of this should be in plugins?)
    > with Protocol::Role::Burst
          (specifies burst behavior)
