Per the RFC:

 * Routes are acyclic; a message to a single user travels in one
   direction, possibly across multiple servers but using the
   shortest possible path.

 * A message to multiple targets is dispatched individually in one
   direction to each target.

 * A message to a channel is relayed to any local users present on the
   channel. Messages are relayed to any peers responsible for
   introducing users present on the channel; the receiving peer
   dispatches to its local clients and to its own peers as-needed until
   the message has been propogated to all clients present.
